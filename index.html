<h3>My Story</h3>
<hr>
</div>
<br>
<p>I Started Youtube on July 29 2024, I Had 3 Subs, Then I Made Videos and Videos and Videos, And I Started Streaming and had Fun You Know.
<br>
I Didn't Start as a VR Youtuber, I was different back then, But I Got a Headset for my Birthday, I Started Playing and Playing, Making Videos on That.
<br>
My First Friend Online is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nuruwill142">Nuruwill142</a>, and We made a Clan of our own back then called "The Lorven Coalition" which was to combat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bellathewolf.">bella the wolf</a>, which was later crushed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PACKVENGERS">THE PACKVENGERS</a> I Dont like bella
<br>
Then I Had a Friend named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TippOnVR">TippVR</a>, which i confronted one time, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TippOnVR">TippVR</a> didn't like that, So he brought his friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpinnerVr">SpinnerVR</a>, So I Got Volt <i>aka Pogchamp, Voltgaming01</i>, and Bang Boom
<br>
It went so far that Tipp Wanted the Win, But I Won and Then I Moved On, I Kept Working and Working on My Content, Meanwhile I Helped a Fan with a Sub Beggar, I Only Made Call Out Vids.
<br>
Then I Kept Moving and Moving and Then I Hit 1K, Im Now Friends with a UG Moderator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dr.CheeseIT">Dr.CheezeIT</a>, And Friends with another Youtuber that we both grew together named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DockderDEE">TechdoVR</a>, Now Known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DockderDEE">DockderDEE</a>.
<br>
I'm Still Going to this Day!</p>
